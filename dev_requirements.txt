# WARNING: Do NOT bump any of the packages below without a good reason.
#
# We intentionally keep the versions as they are, to generate code that is compatible
# with protobuf 3.19.6, which is our minimum requirement. The package versions have been verified
# against this protobuf version. Code generated will newer packages will break compatibility.
#
# Note that this specific version will not compile on Python versions higher than 3.10.
# Using 3.9 for generating the code is preferred anyway, as this is our lowest supported Python release.
